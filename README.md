More is Less: Attention Dilution in In-Context Learning with Large Language Models

## Environment
The codes of MoreIsLess are implemented and tested under the following development environment:
* python=3.11.5
* pandas=2.0.3
* transformers=4.36.2
* ctransformers=0.2.27

## Datasets
We utilized Hate Speech Detection datasets to construct examples in In-Context Learning: [Davidson et al. (2017)]([https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04009](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/blob/master/data/labeled_data.csv)): https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04009

## How to run
